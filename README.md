# CSUGroundStation
Aries VI ground station codebase

This was a very rudimentary groundstation codebase that utilized a Raspberry Pi and radio module
to collect instrumentation data from the rocket and display it on the ground as well as persist it to storage.

The eventual hope would be to utilize passing data over a serial USB port to a laptop based application for more intensive data visualization tasks.
